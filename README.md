****GENERATING-REALISTIC-IMAGES-OF-HUMAN-FACES-FROM-A-DATASET-OF-FACIAL-IMAGES****

**OVERVIEW**

Generating synthetic images can be used to augment training datasets for face recognition algorithms, leading to more robust and accurate models.It helps in handling scenarios with limited training data or dealing with variations in lighting conditions, poses, and expressions. It Has
Applications in Medical Imaging Research and Training, Forensics Investigations and Law Enforcement. Generating realistic images can be used to augment datasets for training Deep Learning models. By synthesizing additional data points, it helps in improving model performance, generalization, and robustness. This is particularly valuable when the original dataset is limited in size or lacks diversity.Deep learning models typically requires a large amount of labeled data for training. Data Augmentation techniques, such as generating synthetic images, help to increase the effective size of the training set by creating additional examples with realistic variations.
